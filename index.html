    </h1>
    <p>Two inseparable best friends, Seth and Evan navigate the last weeks of high school and are invited to their first house party.
      Together with their nerdy friend “Mclovin”, they spend a long day trying to get enough alcohol to supply the party and get two girls  tipsies   in order to kick-start their sex lives before they go off to college.
      It gets complicated after one of them falls in with two inept cops who take him under their wing to show him a good time.
      While the other two are struggling to get the supplies to the party.
